# Pipeline Overview

This document describes the end-to-end computational pipeline used to design and validate RNA aptamers specific to Amyloid-β42.

## Pipeline Flow

1.  **Sequence Generation (`generate_sequences.py`)**:
    *   Generates sequences across four design levels (L1–L4).
    *   Applies GC-content filters and structural motifs (tetraloops).
    *   Performs iterative mutational refinement for Level 4 candidates.

2.  **Structural Stability Analysis (`run_rnafold.py`)**:
    *   Predicts secondary structures using the ViennaRNA package.
    *   Calculates minimum free energy (ΔG) to assess thermodynamic stability.

3.  **Molecular Docking (`vina_runner.py`)**:
    *   Executes high-exhaustiveness docking using AutoDock Vina.
    *   Evaluates binding affinity against Aβ42 and multiple off-target proteins.
    *   Uses standardized grid parameters defined in `configs/docking_parameters.yaml`.

4.  **Data Compilation (`compile_results.py`)**:
    *   Merges all outputs into a single master dataset (`data/raw_data.csv`).
    *   Calculates selectivity ratios and performs quality control checks.

## Origin of Results

The results reported in the research paper are derived directly from the master dataset generated by this pipeline. Each data point can be traced back to a specific computational step, ensuring transparency and reproducibility.

## Limitations

*   **In Silico Nature**: This is a purely computational study. While the pipeline uses validated tools, the results represent predictions that require future *in vitro* validation.
*   **Static Docking**: The docking protocol uses rigid receptor structures, which may not fully capture the conformational flexibility of RNA-protein interactions.
